Statecharts is a graphical modelling language developed to describe complex, reactive systems. Because of its usefulness for describing complex, timed, reactive, state-based behaviour, it is well-suited for developing rich user interfaces, including user interfaces built on Open Web technologies.

Statecharts was first described by David Harel in the 1987 paper "Statecharts: A Visual Formalism for Complex Systems". Over the years, there have been many different Statecharts variants, including the W3C SCXML draft specification. SCXML provides an XML-based syntax for describing Statecharts, as well as a step algorithm which defines its executable semantics. 

*StateCharts Interpretation and Optimization eNgine* (SCION) is an implementation of Statecharts in JavaScript. Statecharts are written as XML documents, which are then executed by the SCION interpreter. Furthermore, optimized data structures may be generated ahead-of-time by SCION from the source SCXML document, which may improve memory usage and performance at runtime. 

The SCION project also includes a custom test suite for distributed unit and performance testing of SCXML interpreters.
